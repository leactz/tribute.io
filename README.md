# tribute.io

/*A single-page tribute site. The first project of the basic Front-End Dev program at Freecodecamp.com. This is my remake of that first project of mine. The project was originally done on codepen.io and can still be viewed in its original state here: http://s.codepen.io/LeaCtz/debug/oLLEYL I cleaned up the markup a LOT. Of course, it won't be perfect yet. But it sure is better. I also felt more confident to express exactly what was in my heart for the site, being more comfortable with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I think it shows a bit of how far I've come in this short time of studying the basics of front-end dev.

Another thing that I did with this page is to NOT use any ID selectors in my CSS, since I found out last night it is not considered best 
practice to do so. 

This page is dedicated to all my friends. Past, present and future. */
