    <div class="container bodyContent">
      <h3 class="text-responsive text-center">There is hope, joy and eternal life in Jesus Christ.
        God sent His only begotten Son to restore us to freedom and make us righteous before Him.
        When we are reborn, our hearts start to change and we become new creatures.</h3>
      <p class="text-responsive par1">Think about it - the entire human race
        is preoccupied with reaching a 'higher state of consciousness' -
        In each and every world religion, spiritual practice or philosophical school of thought there is a single pattern:
        We are trying to get back to the 'higher spiritual state' that humanity inherently feels is missing.
        Whatever we believe, we are trying to get back to God - to 'transcend'. Some of us try to become our own gods. Some of us even choose
      to align ourselves with satan, the destroyer of mankind and enemy of God. We believe the lie that satan is the giver of knowledge, the 'bringer of light.'
    We believe that <em>anything</em> is better than the God of the Bible. This is a lie, and it is the oldest lie in the universe. It will only
  serve to destroy us and call us further away from our purpose. Don't be afraid though - Jesus can restore us to our true state of freedom.</p><br/>
        <p class="text-responsive">We are trying to mould God into what we want Him to be. Into what we feel we are comfortable with Him being.
        Here is the truth: The truth is absolute. As soon as truth becomes relative, it can no longer qualify as truth. You and I
        feel most comfortable with 'my truth' and 'your truth.' This can not be. The only truth is God's truth. Otherwise the concept
        of truth itself would be false.</p>

        <h3 class="text-responsive text-center">I am the Truth, the Life and the Way. Nobody comes to the Father, but by Me - Jesus</h3>

        <p class="text-responsive par1">How does the sacrifice of Jesus work?
          Because of our own choices and the history of mankind, our nature is not as our Creator originally intended. However,
          God's purpose for our lives could never be rightfully fulfilled if we did not have the free will to choose it.
          This is why we had the free will to believe the lie of the world.
          Now, we also have the choice to accept the truth and become truly and authentically free. Because our Father is holy and just,
          we are separated from Him by our sinful nature.
          The only way that we could be reunited with our Father is to cover our sin with something equally as holy as He is.
          This is where the blood of Jesus Christ comes in. God says in His Word, the Bible, that the blood is the life. Jesus Christ is holy. Therefore the blood He shed for us, is holy.
          Jesus gave His holy blood AND His holy life, in the place of our own imperfect blood and lives.
          Try to imagine the worst pain, humiliation or persecution that you could suffer.
          Jesus suffered that in your place.</p><br/>
          <p class="text-responsive">Sometimes the sin we do comes from the best of intentions. This is because we as humans rely on our own hearts to give us direction.
            However, the human heart is deceitful above all things. How many times have you caused harm to another without intending it?
            How many times have your good intentions meant nothing when you hurt the person you were trying to help? How many times have you
            hurt <em>yourself?</em></p><br/>
            <p class="text-responsive">We as humans hurt each other by nature, we cause havoc and destruction. We hurt ourselves and others - thereby hurting God's creation.
            That which is loved by God.
          Rightfully, we should be the ones who are crucified. A just and holy God would not be able to share his eternal kingdom with us if
          we were guilty and sentenced to death, like we each should be. But God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son -
          that whosover shall believe in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
          Therefore we are able to cover ourselves with the blood of Jesus when we accept Him as our Lord and Savior.
          In this state, we become acceptable again to our loving Father, who forgivess us our sins. God also promises us in His Word
          that by the wounds of Jesus, we are healed.
          In Him, there is hope in our dispair and restoration from our brokenness. In Him, each of us can be reborn.</p>

            He was resurrected from the grave for YOU.
            He doesn't care about your criminal record, your sexual orientation, gender-identity or your social status. Jesus cares about your soul. Allow Him to set you free.</p><br/>
          <p>All you need to do is to humbly and honestly ask for Him to show you the way and He will. Study the life of Jesus... Look to Him for the truth, not to what
            you see other people do in the world. He is the Way. Through Him, your understanding of God will become clear and new. Do your reasearch. Pray. Jesus is Lord!</p>
